If not, let me be clear - criticizing Israel and demonizing Jews are two very different things.\n\nThe problem with the image that was the number one post on Reddit this AM&lt; (now #3) is that it demonizes all Jews, but lots of Jews are highly critical of Israel's behavior. Whether by intent or not, the image is eliminationist in the same manner as WW2-era anti-Jewish Nazi propaganda.\n\nLook Reddit, everyone can make mistakes. I don't think we want to go further down this road.\n\nThink about it, OK ?\n\n\n\n**********************************************\n\n\nHere are the two images.

That in turn can make them easier to brutalize or  kill.

Government pays for services, and they are kept alive even if they are unprofitable, they aren't subject to competition in the same way, etc. Private sector runs things, and profit is the goal instead of value, causing predatory business practices, problem-inventing by the solution providers, protection of intellectual property etc. I recently encountered the idea of big government being a \"violence monopoly\" that is being wielded by powerful corporations through corrution, and I find that a compelling and interesting idea.\n\nI know some people are fiscally conservative because they like the idea of \"everyone being entitled to their own earnings\" more than they like the idea of health and happiness for all. Fuck those people, I am not sympathetic to that perspective. However it seems to me like many libertarians believe libertarianism is better for everyone including the poor. Some of the points are compelling, but I still find myself voting straight Dem, more social services, etc. for basically one (economic) reason : The countries in the world with the best quality of life all pretty much seem to be socialist or at least more socialist than the US.

Broadly, a 1,000ft roll of 35mm film lasts around nine-and-a-half minutes before running out, while a digital tape or recording card or hard drive can last from 40 minutes to over an hour and a half. This translates to a very different rhythm on the floor; the pressure to \"cut\" to save film is alleviated.\n\nArchiving digital images is a technological dilemma. The idea of that discovered shoebox of pictures, or wedding album, will not exist digitally in your camera or on your computer or in a \"cloud\": you should print them. I often feel a photochemical image contains the mass of the subject and dimension; a digital image often feels as if it is mass-less. This could be nostalgia or simply how I learned to see. Others will not have this learning: they will probably never experience a photochemical image. Is this loss a tragedy, a revolution, an evolution? What have we lost, and what have we gained?\n\nI will miss walking on to a photochemical film set. It has a magic to me. When the director says: \"Action\", and the film is rolling, it feels like something is at stake. It feels important and intense. In a way, death is present in the rolling of that film \u2013 we live, right now \u2013 and the director says: \"Cut\".

I want to break a record set by a guy named \u201cM1lkfat\u201d for streaming. The record is 54 hours and it\u2019s the longest continuous stream of an RTS/Moba game. Unfortunately I\u2019m not very known so it\u2019s going to be unofficial but if I break it once and gain the attention of Guinness, I could probably do it again with them. The record was broken in HoN and I want to bring to the League of ~~DRAVEN~~ Legends. \n\nI\u2019m a Diamond 1 player and have been playing league since 2010. I started playing seriously last year though, well a year and a half with breaks. I\u2019ll stream Ranked on my Main and Smurf and normals with viewers until I get tired. Then it\u2019s straight normals on my main. The biggest thing that helped me stay awake was answering questions in chat during Runescape so feel free to come on in and ask questions about League.\n\nBack when I streamed Runescape I did minimum of 20 hours per stream and occasionally did 40-48 hour streams for a month straight so I believe I can pull it off. \n\nI currently live in the Skill Capped Gaming House but because I\u2019ll be in the house by myself over the next few days because the WoW guys will all be at Blizzcon. \n\nGoing to Start the Stream sometime after 7pm EST / 4pm PST tomorrow. (Thursday 11/7/2013). \n\nReally hope you seeing you guys in chat and seeing if I can break this record. Rules I believe are 10 minute breaks every hour but I\u2019m not going to use that but to eat. I can also sleep if I stack my breaks but I will also be avoiding that one! See you guys tomorrow!\n\nAccounts are \u201cArmand\u201d and \u201cTutor\u201d.

I suppose this is promotional, but it *is* something I think some of you would like, so if you want to get one, do it now before they're gone.~~\n\nThanks for your questions, and thank you for watching Tabletop. Every day, I'm grateful that I get to play games and share my love of games with the world ... for my job. \n\nThanks for being nice to me, /r/boardgames! I'll come back in a few hours. \n\n**EDIT 2** I came back and answered as many questions as I could. I was informed by mods that a lot of people reported this, because I linked to that woot shirt I did, and promotion is frowned upon around here, so I struck it out.\n\n**EDIT 3** I was told to remove the actual link, so that's what I did. I feel like I'm in a *super* productive Wikipedia edit war, now, so I'm going to bugger off.

A small summary: \nA searched high priest (searched as in doesn't have anything on him that could create a fire) goes into a church and prays. Then fire supposedly appears, and you supposedly can't burn yourself to this fire. He said people put their faces into the fire for seconds, but they wouldn't burn themselves. \n\nLike a lot of other religious myths, I figured there was probably evidence against it to be found on the internet, but I really can't find anything. \n\nAs an agnostic atheist I wanted to ask, do any of you know of any evidence that proves this wrong? Or has it not been investigated yet? I find it hard to accept such an unnatural phenomenon, especially since there are so much religious 'phenomenons' which always get debunked. Yet I can't prove it false without evidence. \n\nEdit: Thanks to you all for the clever ideas! It can be said with relative certainty that this is in fact a fraud. If we ever happen to touch upon this topic again, I'll tell him this. Unfortunately, strong believe is often hard to convince... But knowing myself it's just another religious fraud only makes my skepticism stronger, so it wont'have been for nothing.
