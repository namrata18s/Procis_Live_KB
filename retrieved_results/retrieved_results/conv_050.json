Regarded as a pop icon, Cyrus has been recognized for her evolving artistry and image reinventions. She is a daughter of singer Billy Ray Cyrus, and deemed one of the few examples of a child star with a successful entertainment career as an adult. Cyrus emerged as a teen idol as the title character in the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana (2006\u20132011), which evolved into a commercially successful franchise. As Hannah Montana, she achieved success on the Billboard charts with two number-one soundtracks.\nCyrus's solo career started with the US number-one pop rock albums Meet Miley Cyrus (2007) and Breakout (2008). Her EP The Time of Our Lives (2009) reached number two in the US. Its lead single \"Party in the U.S.A.\" became one of the best-selling singles of all time, and was certified 14-times platinum in the US. Trying to establish a mature image, she explored dance-pop in Can't Be Tamed (2010), which received mixed reviews. Cyrus later signed to RCA Records and took a new artistic direction with the hip hop and R&B-influenced Bangerz (2013). Her fifth chart-topping album, it yielded the hit single \"We Can't Stop\" and her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one \"Wrecking Ball\". She then dabbled in experimental music on Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (2015), embraced country pop on Younger Now (2017), and delved into rock genres on Plastic Hearts (2020). Shifting to Columbia Records in 2021, Cyrus released her eighth studio album Endless Summer Vacation (2023). Its lead single \"Flowers\" became internationally successful, marking her second US number-one song, and winning two Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year.\nAs an actress, Cyrus starred in the films Bolt (2008), Hannah Montana: The Movie (2009), The Last Song (2010), LOL (2012), and So Undercover (2013).

She was named a Disney Legend, in recognition for her contributions to The Walt Disney Company. Cyrus was ranked as one of the greatest artists of all time, the ninth-greatest Billboard 200 female artist, and among the greatest pop stars of the 21st century by Billboard, and is the eighth-highest-certified female digital singles artist by the RIAA.

      "title": "Millennials in the United States",
      "content": "Millennials, also known as Generation Y or Gen Y, are the demographic cohort following Generation X and preceding Generation Z. Unlike their counterparts in most other developed nations, Millennials in the United States are a relatively large cohort in their nation's population, which has implications for their nation's economy and geopolitics. They generally adopt a slow-life history strategy in that compared to previous cohorts, they tend to be highly educated, be less inclined to engage in sexual intercourse, marry later, and have fewer children, or none at all. Furthermore, Millennials are much less religious than older generations, though some still identify as spiritual. Millennials have faced economic challenges posed by the Great Recession, and another one in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But they have been steadily catching up with their elders in terms of inflation-adjusted median household income and home ownership. They also maintain a high level of participation in the labor force.\nMillennials are sometimes known as digital natives because they came of age when the Internet, electronic devices, and social media entered widespread usage. Despite their reputation for holding left-wing views, Millennials are not consistently aligned with liberalism. In fact, they frequently identify as politically independent, and are not idealists. Polling agency Ipsos-MORI warned that \"many of the claims made about millennial characteristics are simplified, misinterpreted or just plain wrong, which can mean real differences get lost\", and that \"[e]qually important are the similarities between other generations\u2014the attitudes and behaviors that are staying the same are sometimes just as important and surprising.\""
