      "content": "Git () is a distributed version control system that tracks versions of files. It is often used to control source code by programmers who are developing software collaboratively.\nDesign goals of Git include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows \u2014 thousands of parallel branches running on different computers. \nAs with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client\u2013server systems, Git maintains a local copy of the entire repository, also known as \"repo\", with history and version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. A repository is stored on each computer in a standard directory with additional, hidden files to provide version control capabilities. Git provides features to synchronize changes between repositories that share history; copied (cloned) from each other. For collaboration, Git supports synchronizing with repositories on remote machines. Although all repositories (with the same history) are peers, developers often use a central server to host a repository to hold an integrated copy. \nGit is free and open-source software shared under the GPL-2.0-only license.\nGit was originally created by Linus Torvalds for version control during the development of the Linux kernel. The trademark \"Git\" is registered by the Software Freedom Conservancy, marking its official recognition and continued evolution in the open-source community. \nToday, Git is the de facto standard version control system. It is the most popular distributed version control system, with nearly 95% of developers reporting it as their primary version control system as of 2022. It is the most widely used source-code management tool among professional developers. There are offerings of Git repository services, including GitHub, SourceForge, Bitbucket and GitLab.\n\n"

      "content": "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.\nPython is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.\nGuido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.\nPython consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, and has gained widespread use in the machine learning community.\n\n"

      "content": "Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI, formerly stylized as LLaMA) is a family of large language models (LLMs) released by Meta AI starting in February 2023. The latest version is Llama 4, released in April 2025.\nLlama models come in different sizes, ranging from 1 billion to 2 trillion parameters. Initially only a foundation model, starting with Llama 2, Meta AI released instruction fine-tuned versions alongside foundation models.\nModel weights for the first version of Llama were only available to researchers on a case-by-case basis, under a non-commercial license. Unauthorized copies of the first model were shared via BitTorrent. Subsequent versions of Llama were made accessible outside academia and released under licenses that permitted some commercial use.\nAlongside the release of Llama 3, Meta added virtual assistant features to Facebook and WhatsApp in select regions, and a standalone website. Both services use a Llama 3 model."

      "title": "Mojo (programming language)",
      "content": "Mojo is a programming language in the Python family that is currently under development. It is available both in browsers via Jupyter notebooks, and locally on Linux and macOS. Mojo aims to combine the usability of a high-level programming language, specifically Python, with the performance of a system programming language such as C++, Rust, and Zig. As of February 2025, the Mojo compiler is closed source with an open source standard library. Modular, the company behind Mojo, has stated an intent to eventually open source the Mojo language, as it matures.\nMojo builds on the Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) compiler software framework instead of directly on the lower level LLVM compiler framework, as do many languages such as Julia, Swift, Clang, and Rust. MLIR is a newer compiler framework that allows Mojo to exploit higher level compiler passes unavailable in LLVM alone, and allows Mojo to compile down and target more than only central processing units (CPUs), including producing code that can run on graphics  processing units (GPUs), Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and other accelerators. It can also often more effectively use certain types of CPU optimizations directly, like single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) with minor intervention by a developer, as occurs in many other languages. According to Jeremy Howard of fast.ai, Mojo can be seen as \"syntax sugar for MLIR\" and for that reason Mojo is well optimized for applications like artificial intelligence (AI)."
