      "content": "Jet streams are fast flowing, narrow air currents in the Earth's atmosphere.\nThe main jet streams are located near the altitude of the tropopause and are westerly winds, flowing west to east around the globe. The northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere each have a polar jet around their respective polar vortex at around 30,000 ft (5.7 mi; 9.1 km) above sea level and typically travelling at around 110 mph (180 km/h) although often considerably faster. Closer to the equator and somewhat higher and somewhat weaker is a subtropical jet. \nThe northern polar jet flows over the middle to northern latitudes of North America, Europe, and Asia and their intervening oceans, while the southern hemisphere polar jet mostly circles Antarctica. Jet streams may start, stop, split into two or more parts, combine into one stream, or flow in various directions including opposite to the direction of the remainder of the jet. \nThe El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation affects the location of the jet streams, which in turn affects the weather over the tropical Pacific Ocean and affects the climate of much of the tropics and subtropics, and can affect weather in higher-latitude regions. The term \"jet stream\" is also applied to some other winds at varying levels in the atmosphere, some global (such as the higher-level polar-night jet), some local (such as the African easterly jet). Meteorologists use the location of some of the jet streams as an aid in weather forecasting.  Airlines use them to reduce some flight times and fuel consumption. Scientists have considered whether the jet streams might be harnessed for power generation. In World War II, the Japanese used the jet stream to carry Fu-Go balloon bombs across the Pacific Ocean to launch small attacks on North America.\nJet streams have been detected in the atmospheres of Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune."

      "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power season 1",
      "content": "The first season of the American fantasy television series The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power is based on J. R. R. Tolkien's history of Middle-earth, primarily material from the appendices of the novel The Lord of the Rings (1954\u201355). Set thousands of years before the novel in Middle-earth's Second Age, the series begins in a time of relative peace and follows various characters as they face the re-emergence of darkness. The season includes a mystery about the whereabouts of the Dark Lord Sauron and concludes with the forging of the first Rings of Power. It was produced by Amazon Studios in association with New Line Cinema and with J. D. Payne and Patrick McKay as showrunners.\nAmazon acquired the television rights to The Lord of the Rings in November 2017. Payne and McKay were set to develop the series in July 2018. They intended for it to be visually consistent with Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings (2001\u20132003) and The Hobbit (2012\u20132014) film trilogies, despite being separate from them. A large international cast was hired and each Middle-earth culture was defined through designs, dialects, and music. Filming began in February 2020 in New Zealand, where the films were produced, but was put on hold in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Production resumed in September and wrapped in August 2021, taking place in Auckland and on location around the country. J. A. Bayona, Wayne Che Yip, and Charlotte Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m directed episodes. Special effects company W\u0113t\u0101 Workshop and visual effects vendor W\u0113t\u0101 FX returned from the films.\nThe season premiered on the streaming service Amazon Prime Video on September 1, 2022, with its first two episodes. This followed a marketing campaign that attempted to win over dissatisfied Tolkien fans. The other six episodes were released weekly until October 14. Amazon said the season was the most-watched of any Prime Video original series and third-party analytics companies also estimated viewership to be high. Initial reviews were generally positive, particularly for the visuals, but there were mixed feelings on the season's Tolkien connections and criticisms for its overall structure. Commentary about the season focused on vocal responses from Tolkien fans, online backlash to the diverse cast, and comparisons with the concurrent fantasy series House of the Dragon. The season received various accolades including six Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Award nominations.\n\n"
