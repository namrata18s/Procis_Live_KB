      "content": "On the American late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show Saturday Night Live (SNL), a commercial advertisement parody is commonly shown after the host's opening monologue. Many of the parodies were produced by James Signorelli.  The industries, products, and ad formats targeted by the parodies have been wide-ranging, including fast food, beer, feminine hygiene products, toys, clothes, medications (both prescription and over-the-counter), financial institutions, automobiles, electronics, appliances, public-service announcements, infomercials, and movie & TV shows (including SNL itself).\nMany of SNL's ad parodies have been featured in prime-time clip shows over the years, including an April 1991 special hosted by Kevin Nealon and Victoria Jackson, as well as an early 1999 follow-up hosted by Will Ferrell that features his attempts to audition for a feminine hygiene commercial.  In late 2005 and in March 2009, the special was modernized, featuring commercials created since the airing of the original special.\n\n"

      "content": "This is a list of episodes for The Daily Show, a late-night talk and satirical news television program airing on Comedy Central, during 2024.\nFollowing the departure of host Trevor Noah at the end of 2022, a series of guest hosts from both within and outside The Daily Show's correspondents roster filled the program's anchor chair throughout 2023, each sitting in for a one-week assignment. On January 24, 2024, it was announced that Jon Stewart would return to the show he had hosted from 1999 to 2015. This time around, in addition to serving as an executive producer, Stewart would host one episode per week, primarily on Mondays; Stewart's hosting commitment was originally planned to run through the 2024 U.S. election cycle, though it would be announced on October 28 that he would continue as a once-per-week host through December 2025. The rest of the week, members of \"The Best F#@king News Team\" would rotate hosting duties.\nUnless otherwise indicated, The Daily Show episodes were pre-taped, though live-to-air shows would take place throughout the year, including the concluding nights of the Republican and Democratic national conventions, the nights of presidential and vice-presidential debates, and Election Night. Also unless indicated, episodes were taped at TDS's longtime home at NEP Studio 52 on 11th Avenue in New York City, though the show did originate from Chicago's Athenaeum Center for Thought & Culture the week of the Democratic Convention (August 19\u201322).  The show had planned to do the same in Milwaukee the week that city hosted the RNC (July 15\u201318), but instead returned to New York for three shows (July 16\u201318), with Stewart noting that the Milwaukee theater where the show set up was shifted from a \"soft\" to \"hard\" security perimeter in the wake of GOP candidate Donald Trump\u2019s attempted assassination."

      "title": "List of The Muppet Show episodes",
      "content": "The Muppet Show is a live-action/puppet television series that was created by Jim Henson and produced by ITC Entertainment and Henson Associates. It premiered on 5 September 1976 and ended on 23 May 1981, with a total of 120 episodes over the course of 5 seasons.\nThe rights to the series are currently owned by The Muppets Studio (a division of The Walt Disney Company), having been acquired from The Jim Henson Company in February 2004.\nThe 120 episodes were produced in the UK between 1976 and 1980; two pilot episodes were also produced, one in 1974 and the other in 1975. The UK broadcasts featured extra scenes that were not seen on US TV. There is no set broadcast order for the episodes, as they were shown in varying order in different regions. For the Season One DVD box set that was released in 2005, Buena Vista Home Entertainment placed the episodes in the order in which they were produced, rather than aired, for this reason. Due to the sequence in which the episodes are organized on DVD disc 1, Scooter is part of the backstage staff before his first appearance (Jim Nabors episode). The set also includes the longer UK versions of each of the episodes, though six song sequences were cut from the set because of licensing issues. It is common for television executives to insist on an edit of video release rather than pay money to the owners of the copyright of songs. Examples include the Vincent Price episode, the closing number of which, \"You've Got a Friend\", is cut on The Muppet Show: Season One DVD; it is available uncut and in English on the German DVD.\nThe tables below list episodes based on their initial airing dates, for the United Kingdom, except for the two pilots. Thus they may not necessarily be the order in which episodes were shown in all regions.\nThe Muppet Show was released for streaming on Disney+ on 19 February 2021. However, two episodes featuring guests Brooke Shields and Chris Langham are omitted from the streaming service, the former due to music licensing issues, and the latter possibly due to the actor's child pornography arrest. In several European countries, the episode featuring John Denver is omitted as well."
