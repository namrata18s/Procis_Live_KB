      "title": "1963 San Diego Chargers season",
      "content": "The 1963 San Diego Chargers season was the team's fourth in the American Football League. The team had gone 4\u201310 in 1962 but rebounded with an 11\u20133 record, winning the AFL West by one game over the Oakland Raiders, who were coached by former Chargers assistant Al Davis. San Diego scored the most points in the league and conceded the fewest. Their offense, led by veteran quarterback Tobin Rote, and featuring future Hall of Fame receiver Lance Alworth, gained more yards than any other team; Rote and Alworth were each named the league MVP, by the Associated Press and UPI, respectively.\nOn January 5, 1964, the team won their only AFL Championship with a 51\u201310 win over the Boston Patriots in Balboa Stadium. To date, this is the Chargers' only league championship season in the AFL or NFL. This is also the only world championship won by a major league sports team in the city and county of San Diego to date. In 2003, the team was inducted into the Chargers Ring of Honor. The emphatic title game victory led to some speculation on whether San Diego might be able to beat the NFL champion Chicago Bears.\nThe 1963 Chargers earned a degree of lasting notoriety due to their program of anabolic steroid usage, the first such in professional football. Head coach Sid Gillman and strength coach Alvin Roy made daily doses of Dianabol compulsory for a five-week period during training camp before players became aware of potential side effects, and the program was relaxed to a voluntary one."

      "content": "The 2002 season was the San Diego Chargers' 33rd in the National Football League (NFL), their 43rd overall and their first under head coach Marty Schottenheimer. Their stadium, Qualcomm Stadium, hosted Super Bowl XXXVII at the end of the season, but the Chargers' failure to secure a playoff berth marked the 18th straight season that the Super Bowl did not include the team in whose region the game was being played. Their division was reduced to four teams at the start of the season, with the Seattle Seahawks moving to the NFC. Despite going into their bye week with a 6\u20131 record, the Chargers suffered a late-season collapse, winning just two out of their last nine games after their bye week and missing the postseason.\nThis season would be the last for two longtime defensive stalwarts in Charger uniforms; as future Hall-of-Fame linebacker Junior Seau would leave for the Miami Dolphins; while longtime safety Rodney Harrison would likewise leave for New England. Seau and Harrison would be reunited with the Patriots from 2006 until Harrison's retirement after the 2008 season."
