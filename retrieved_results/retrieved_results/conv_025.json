      "content": "The 2008 season was the Green Bay Packers' 88th season in the National Football League (NFL), their 90th overall and their 3rd under head coach Mike McCarthy. The Packers were aiming to improve their 13\u20133 record from last season, but finished the season with a 6\u201310 record and missed the playoffs.  Until the 2017 season, this was the last season in which the Packers did not qualify for the playoffs.\nIt was the first season since 1991 that quarterback Brett Favre was not on the team's roster. Favre retired in March, decided to come back over the summer and was ultimately traded to the New York Jets after the team told Favre playing in Green Bay again was not an option. It was the first season with quarterback Aaron Rodgers as the team's starter."

Overcoming a disappointing 4\u201312 record, quarterback Michael Vick's dog fighting scandal and head coach Bobby Petrino's abrupt resignation in 2007, the Falcons, who were expected to be in a rebuilding phase, completed the regular season with a surprising 11\u20135 record and earned the #5 seed in the NFC playoffs under first-year head coach Mike Smith; however, the team fell to the eventual NFC champion Arizona Cardinals in the wild-card round of the playoffs.\nMike Smith was named 2008 NFL Coach of the Year, and quarterback Matt Ryan earned the Offensive Rookie of the Year Award."
