      "content": "Masculinity (also called manhood or manliness) is a set of attributes, behaviors, and roles generally associated with men and boys. Masculinity can be theoretically understood as socially constructed, and there is also evidence that some behaviors considered masculine are influenced by both cultural factors and biological factors. To what extent masculinity is biologically or socially influenced is subject to debate. It is distinct from the definition of the biological male sex, as anyone can exhibit masculine traits. Standards of masculinity vary across different cultures and historical periods. In Western cultures, its meaning is traditionally drawn from being contrasted with femininity."

      "title": "Rick Grimes",
      "content": "Richard D. \"Rick\" Grimes is a fictional character and the main  protagonist of the post-apocalyptic comic book series The Walking Dead, the live-action television series of the same name and its franchise, in which he is portrayed by Andrew Lincoln. Created by writer Robert Kirkman and artist Tony Moore, the character made his debut in The Walking Dead #1 in 2003. Rick is a small town sheriff's deputy and is married to Lori. They have a son, Carl, and a daughter, Judith. He awakens from a coma after a life-threatening gunshot wound to find the world overrun by reanimated humans dubbed \"walkers\".\nIn the comic book series The Walking Dead, Rick served as the protagonist, with the series' epilogue taking place decades after his death. In both media, Rick awakens from a coma into the apocalypse and searches for Lori and Carl, finding them in the Atlanta camp where he becomes the group's leader. Although Rick quickly adapts to the notion of killing walkers, his morality towards the living is constantly tested against the safety of his family and friends. Over time, after multiple conflicts with other survivors, his morals diminish and he becomes \"colder\" towards his enemies. Rick struggles to keep his humanity intact throughout the series. He is tested by his own group when encountering non-group members, who believe his community should join them. Rick manages to rebuild his convictions through agreeing to join, and becoming a father once more, but antagonists exploitation of his group ushers him to maintain a hardened stance. Ultimately, they succeed in rebuilding society. An alternate version of Rick, dubbed Rick Grimes 2000, is introduced in Issue 75 in 2010, from a reality where an alien invasion occurred in the midst of the \"Alexandria\" arc and Rick was rebuilt as a cyborg to face a resurrected Governor; a comic book limited series following the character, Skybound X: Rick Grimes 2000, was released from July 7 to August 4, 2021.\nRick has been described as an everyman character who emphasizes moral codes and values. Lincoln obtained the role in April 2010; Kirkman felt he was an \"amazing find\". In preparation for the role, Lincoln sought inspiration from Gary Cooper in his work in the American western film High Noon (1952), as well as the television drama series Breaking Bad. Lincoln has been well-received for his portrayal of the character, and has been nominated for several awards, winning the Saturn Award for Best Actor on Television in 2015 and 2017."
