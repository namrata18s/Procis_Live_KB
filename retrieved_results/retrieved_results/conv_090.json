      "content": "ThinkPad  is a line of business-oriented laptop and tablet computers produced since 1992. The early models were designed, created and manufactured by International Business Machines (IBM) until it sold its PC business to Lenovo in 2005; since 2007, all new ThinkPad models have been branded Lenovo instead and the Chinese manufacturer has continued to develop and sell ThinkPads to the present day.\n\nThe ThinkPad line was first developed at the IBM Yamato Facility in Japan; they have a distinct black, boxy design, which originated in 1990 and is still used in some models. Most models also feature a red-colored trackpoint on the keyboard, which has become an iconic and distinctive design characteristic associated with the ThinkPad line. It has seen significant success in the business market while certain models target students and the education market. ThinkPad laptops have been used in outer space and for many years were the only laptops certified for use on the International Space Station (ISS). ThinkPads have also for several years been one of the preferred laptops used by the United Nations.\n\n"

      "title": "2020s in fashion",
      "content": "The fashions of the 2020s represent a departure from 2010s fashion and feature a nostalgia for older aesthetics. They have been largely inspired by styles of the late 1990s to mid-2000s, 1980s and 1960s. Early in the decade, several publications noted the shortened trend and nostalgia cycle in 2020s fashion. Fashion was also shaped by the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a major impact on the fashion industry, and led to shifting retail and consumer trends.\nIn the 2020s, many companies, including current fast fashion giants such as Shein and Temu, have been using social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram as a marketing tool. Marketing strategies involving third parties, particularly influencers and celebrities, have become prominent tactics. E-commerce platforms which promote small businesses, such as Depop and Etsy, grew by offering vintage, homemade, or resold clothing from individual sellers. Thrifting has also exploded in popularity due to it being centered around finding valuable pieces of clothing at a reasonable price."

      "content": "A coupe or coup\u00e9 (, also US: ) is a passenger car with a sloping or truncated rear roofline and typically with two doors.\nThe term coup\u00e9 was first applied to horse-drawn carriages for two passengers without rear-facing seats. It comes from the French past participle of couper, \"cut\". \nSome coup\u00e9 cars only have two seats, while some also feature rear seats. However, these rear seats are usually lower quality and much smaller than those in the front. Furthermore, \"A fixed-top two-door sports car would be best and most appropriately be termed a 'sports coupe' or 'sports coup\u00e9'\".\n\n"

      "title": "Generation Z",
      "content": "Generation Z (often shortened to Gen Z), also known as zoomers, is the demographic cohort succeeding Millennials and preceding Generation Alpha. Researchers and popular media use the mid-to-late 1990s as starting birth years, specifically 1995 by some academic and the early 2010s as ending birth years. However, the generation most frequently being defined as people born from 1997 to 2012. Most members of Generation Z are the children of Generation X.\nGeneration Z has been described as \"better behaved and less hedonistic\" than previous generations. They have fewer teenage pregnancies, consume less alcohol (but not necessarily other psychoactive drugs), and are more focused on school and job prospects. They are also better at delaying gratification than teens from the 1960s. Members of this generation are characterized by having started and graduated high school in the 2010s or early 2020s, having few to no direct memories of 9/11 and being in college or entering the workplace during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sexting became popular during Gen Z's adolescent years, although the long-term psychological effects are not yet fully understood. Youth subcultures have not disappeared, but they have been quieter. Nostalgia is a major theme of youth culture in the 2010s and 2020s.\nGlobally, there is evidence that girls in Generation Z experienced puberty at considerably younger ages compared to previous generations, with implications for their welfare and their future. Furthermore, the prevalence of allergies among adolescents and young adults in this cohort is greater than the general population; there is greater awareness and diagnosis of mental health conditions, and sleep deprivation is more frequently reported.\nIn many countries, Generation Z youth are more likely to be diagnosed with intellectual disabilities and psychiatric disorders than older generations. Generation Z tend to be more socially progressive than other generations and are one of the most interconnected generations in the world.\nIn Asia, educators in the 2000s and 2010s typically sought out and nourished top students; in Western Europe and the United States, the emphasis was on poor performers. East Asian and Singaporean students consistently earned the top spots in international standardized tests in the 2010s."

      "title": "Sandbox game",
      "content": "A sandbox game is a video game with a gameplay element that provides players a great degree of creativity to interact with, usually without any predetermined goal, or with a goal that the players set for themselves. Such games may lack any objective, and are sometimes referred to as non-games or software toys. Very often, sandbox games result from these creative elements being incorporated into other genres and allowing for emergent gameplay. Sandbox games are often associated with an open world concept which gives the players freedom of movement and progression in the game's world. The term \"sandbox\" derives from the nature of a sandbox that lets people create nearly anything they want within it.\nEarly sandbox games came out of space trading and combat games like Elite (1984) and city-building simulations and tycoon games like SimCity (1989). The releases of The Sims and Grand Theft Auto III in 2000 and 2001, respectively, demonstrated that games with highly detailed interacting systems that encouraged player experimentation could also be seen as sandbox games. Sandbox games also found ground with the ability to interact socially and share user-generated content across the Internet like Second Life (2003). More notable sandbox games include Garry's Mod (2006) and Dreams (2020), where players use the game's systems to create environments and modes to play with. Minecraft (2011) is the most successful example of a sandbox game, with players able to enjoy both creative modes and more goal-driven survival modes. Roblox (2006) offers a chance for everyone to create their own game by using the Roblox Lua programming language. It allows adding effects, setting up functions, testing games, etc. Fortnite (2017) has game modes which allow players to either fight one another, fight off monsters, create their own battle arenas, race their friends, or jam out to popular songs with instruments."
