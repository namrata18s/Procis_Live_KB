      "title": "List of Doctor Who episodes (2005\u2013present)",
      "content": "Doctor Who is a British science fiction television programme produced by the BBC. Having ceased broadcasting in 1989, it resumed in 2005. The 2005 revival traded the earlier multi-episode serial format of the original series for a run of self-contained episodes, interspersed with occasional multi-part stories and structured into loose story arcs.\nDoctor Who depicts the adventures of an extraterrestrial being called the Doctor, part of a humanoid species called Time Lords. The Doctor travels in the universe and in time using a time travelling spaceship called the TARDIS, which externally appears as a British police box. While travelling, typically with companions, the Doctor works to save lives and liberate oppressed peoples by combating various enemies. The Doctor has been played by various actors; the transition between actors is written into the plot with the concept of regeneration, a plot device in which a Time Lord's cells regenerated when they are fatally injured and they are reincarnated into a different body. Each actor's distinct portrayal represents different stages in the Doctor's life and, together, they form a single lifetime and narrative.\nSix actors have led the revived series in the role of the Doctor under three showrunners, beginning with Christopher Eccleston as the Ninth Doctor and Russell T Davies as showrunner. Eccleston departed the role after the first series, succeeded by David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor, who played the role for three regular series. Tennant and Davies departed following a series of specials, replaced by Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor and Steven Moffat as showrunner, respectively. Smith portrayed the character for three series, leaving after the 2013 specials. Peter Capaldi took over the role for three series as the Twelfth Doctor; he and Moffat departed following the 2017 Christmas special. Capaldi was replaced by Jodie Whittaker, the first woman to play the role, as the Thirteenth Doctor; Chris Chibnall became showrunner. After three series, Whittaker and Chibnall left at the end of the 2022 specials, and Davies returned for a second term as showrunner. Tennant returned as the Fourteenth Doctor in the 60th anniversary specials, succeeded by Ncuti Gatwa as the Fifteenth Doctor, who has headlined the series since 2024.\nAs of 12 April 2025, 885 episodes of Doctor Who have aired. This includes one television movie and multiple specials, and encompasses 313 stories over 41 seasons, starting in 1963; out of these, 189 are from the revived series, encompassing 157 stories over 15 series and various specials. The programme's high episode count has resulted in Doctor Who holding the world record for the highest number of episodes of a science-fiction programme. As of November 2023, up to a seventeenth series of the revived era has been planned. The story numbers below are meant as a guide to placement in the overall context of the programme. The numbering scheme in this list follows the official website's episode guide; other sources sometimes diverge in their numbering."

      "title": "Twelfth Doctor",
      "content": "The Twelfth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who. He is portrayed by Scottish actor Peter Capaldi in three series as well as four specials. As with previous incarnations of the Doctor, the character has also appeared in other Doctor Who spin-offs. \nWithin the series' narrative, the Doctor is a millennia-old alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in the TARDIS, frequently with companions. When they are about to die, the Doctor regenerates; as a result, the physical appearance and personality of the Doctor changes. Capaldi's portrayal of the Doctor starts out as a spiky, brusque, contemplative, and pragmatic character who conceals his emotions in the course of making tough and sometimes ruthless decisions. Over time, he becomes kinder, compassionate, and more openly showcases his selflessness. Preceded in regeneration by the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith), he is followed by the Thirteenth Doctor (Jodie Whittaker).\nThis incarnation's companions include school teacher Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman), who travelled with his previous incarnation, for his first two series; and for his final series, canteen assistant and student Bill Potts (Pearl Mackie) and alien Nardole (Matt Lucas). He also made a guest appearance in the Doctor Who spin-off series Class, appearing in the show's first episode.\n\n"

      "title": "Deep Breath (Doctor Who)",
      "content": "\"Deep Breath\" is the first episode of the eighth series of the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who, first broadcast on BBC One and released in cinemas on 23 August 2014. It was written by showrunner and executive producer Steven Moffat and directed by Ben Wheatley. \nIn the episode, the newly regenerated Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi), and Clara (Jenna Coleman) land in Victorian London where they find a dinosaur rampant in the Thames and a spate of deadly spontaneous combustions. However, their friendship is put in jeopardy as Clara struggles to cope with the Doctor's new incarnation.\nThe episode has the first full-length appearance of Peter Capaldi as the Doctor, with Coleman reprising her role as his companion Clara from the last series.  It also features Neve McIntosh, Catrin Stewart, and Dan Starkey reprising their roles as Madame Vastra, Jenny Flint, and Strax, as well as Capaldi's predecessor, Matt Smith, in a cameo appearance. The episode sets up the main story arc of the series revolving around a mysterious woman called Missy (portrayed by Michelle Gomez), who is often seen welcoming people who have died throughout the series to the \"Promised Land\", a place that serves as an apparent afterlife to deceased characters.\nDeep Breath was watched by 9.17 million viewers, the highest ratings for a premiere since Matt Smith's first episode as the Doctor in 2010 and received positive reviews, with many critics praising the performances of Capaldi and Coleman, Moffat's script, and the introduction and stylisation of the new Doctor, though Smith's cameo received mixed reviews."

      "title": "Doctor Who series 14",
      "content": "The fourteenth series of the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who premiered on 11 May 2024, and aired through to 22 June. The series is also known as \"Season One\" following the production changes and the acquisition of Doctor Who's international broadcasting rights by Disney+. It is the fifth series led by Russell T Davies as head writer and executive producer and the first since his return to the show, having previously worked on it from 2005 to 2010. This series is the fourteenth to air since the programme's revival in 2005, and the fortieth season overall. The fourteenth series was announced with Davies' return for its 60th anniversary in 2023 and beyond, with Bad Wolf becoming a co-producer.\nThe series is the first to star Ncuti Gatwa as the Fifteenth Doctor, a new incarnation of the Doctor, an alien Time Lord who travels through time and space in the TARDIS, which appears to be a British police box from the outside. The Fifteenth Doctor was introduced in \"The Giggle\" (2023) through a \"bi-generation\", in which he split from his predecessor, the Fourteenth Doctor (David Tennant), rather than replacing him. The series also introduces Millie Gibson as the Doctor's newest companion, Ruby Sunday.\nPreceded by a Christmas episode on 25 December 2023, the series consists of eight episodes directed by Julie Anne Robinson, Ben Chessell, Dylan Holmes Williams, and Jamie Donoughue. Alongside Davies, who wrote six of the episodes, the writers are Kate Herron, Briony Redman, and former showrunner and head writer Steven Moffat. Filming began in December 2022 and concluded in July 2023. It was the first series to be produced at Wolf Studios Wales, following the move from Roath Lock Studios for the preceding anniversary specials. Reviews for the series were mostly positive, although some criticized the resolution to the series' story arc. The fourteenth series saw a decline in overnight viewing figures and an increase in long-term viewership."
